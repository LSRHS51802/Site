       <h1> I believe a person with citizenship cares about their community and help the community any way they can.
<ul>
 <li>Honesty is to always tell the truth and never lie about something if it is bad or good. Honesty is needed for good citizenship because if the whole community is constantly telling the truth they will be able to help their community for example if there was a bank robber on the run and everyone tell the officers where they last saw him or know where he is the community will be safer.</li>
<li>Compassion is feeling bad and helping the needy. Compassion is definitely needed for good citizenship because if more and more people are helping the homeless and poor get of the streets the less people we will have to worry about on the streets.If the homeless and poor are showed that they are loved and belong just like everyone else they will reflect on their actions and not try to become homeless again.</li>
<li>Respect is acknowledging that a person has done something that has helped someone else. I think respect is essential for good citizenship because if everyone respects someone that has done a good deed that person is going to go out and do more good deeds which will make evryone want to do good deeds.</li>
